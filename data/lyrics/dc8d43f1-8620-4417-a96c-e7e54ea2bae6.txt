[Intro]
Is everybody ready to rock?
Let me tell you somethin' about rock

[Verse 1]
I was stuck like a stone
Down in the Nether 'til you came along
But your faith in me
Gave me the power to set me free
I don't wanna be
Runnin' from zombies for the rest of our lives
Let's be creative 'til the day that we die
Now, do I have to tell ya one more time?

[Interlude]
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
I used to wake up and play back in my childhood days
Getting older's such a dirty shame
They never gave me a chance to let my imagination dance
'Til I came up with a different game

[Pre-Chorus]
Down in the mines, all of the time (Craftin')
Out in the sun, having some fun (Laughin')
Found the love I'm dreamin' of, yes, now
I'm never ever lookin' back, 'cause

[Chorus]
I feel alive
I move mountains with my mind
I feel the high
With the power of the wolf inside, here we go
I feel alive, yeah
Woo

[Verse 3]
I got the power of flight, I move the speed of light
That portal's finished and it's ready to go
I'm gonna jump right through, I'm comin' straight for you
The Ender Dragon is a hell of a foe
Come on now

[Pre-Chorus]
Down in the mines, all of the time (Craftin')
Out in the sun, having some fun (Laughin')
Found the love I'm dreamin' of, yes, now
I'm never ever lookin' back, 'cause

[Chorus]
I feel alive
I move mountains with my mind
I feel the high
Like a new moon on the rise
I feel alive
When the colors of the world collide
I feel the high
With the power of the wolf inside

[Bridge]
We need to work it out
The Creepers scream and shout
They start to overload
They mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-might just explode

[Guitar Solo]
Craftin'
Laughin'

[Pre-Chorus]
I have to say it again, now
I'm never ever lookin' back, 'cause

[Chorus]
I feel alive
I move mountains with my mind
I feel the high
Like a new moon on the rise
I feel alive
Like a redstone overdrive
I feel the high
With the power of the wolf inside
I feel alive, yeah
