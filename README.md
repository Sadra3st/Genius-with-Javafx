# 🎵 Genius - Music-Lyrics-Platform

I made this app for my Nowruz-Project in Advanced Programming course at SBU university.
I started by learning javafx and then building a simple login and register app. Then I added different roles for users and brick by brick I made this app. So without anymore stories lests dive into it!

###  P.S
I wanted to add many other features like following,analyzing,customization for profile screen and writing a bio to apply to become an artist and you can 
still see some unused/unfinished code in my project because I wasn't able to do it due to lack of much Java knowledge and limited time.
So if you have any ideas to improve this app feel free to tell me!
